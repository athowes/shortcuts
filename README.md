| Name | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `orderly` develop start plus | Like `orderly::orderly_develop_start` but also changes the directory: if you have `report/script.R` then it will set your directory to that file, as well as calling `orderly::orderly_develop_start("report")`. |
| `orderly` develop clean plus | Like `orderly::orderly_develop_clean` but for every report in your repository. |
